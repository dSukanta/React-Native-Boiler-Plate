# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

**git init**
**git clone https://github.com/dSukanta/React-Native-Boiler-Plate.git**,

```bash
# using npm
npm install

```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

* To change App icon: 
  go to  **iconkitchen website.**
 **create and download** the zipped icon folder
 unzip the folder and select **android** folder 
**copy or cut** everything inside the folder.
go to **android/app/src/main/res** in your project and paste everything. 

* To change App name: 
go to **android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml** in your project and write the app name inside the **string** tag.
